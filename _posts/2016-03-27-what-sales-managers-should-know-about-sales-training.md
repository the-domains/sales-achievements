**What Sales Managers Should Know About Sales
Training!**

****

Did you know that sales training doesn't work? No, you didn't
misread that! It's a fact that sales managers need to know, or ignore at their
peril. 

A sales team can be one of the best ROIs a business has;
attracting new business and closing profitable deals, while maintaining
customer loyalty and promoting a company's corporate image. 

Working hand in hand with marketing departments and driving
forward with a powerful sales methodology, a strong sales manager at the helm
can steer the ship of profit or loss towards hidden treasure. However, sales
training is not enough to successfully navigate your sales crew. 

__

_Relying on sales training alone, sales
department heads can soon lose control, with sales executives struggling against
a tide of inefficiency and declining sales. _

Managers
are always being encouraged to invest in training, education, and ultimately
people, which is all good and well. However, there are several
business-affecting reasons why sales training simply isn't enough:

\*

Once learned...always
forgotten: 

Sales training can make executives feel valued and sales
managers feel secure. However, once the feel-good factor has worn off, these
learnt skills soon fade. According to the Association for Talent Development,
80% of new skills are lost within the first week of training, if they are not
applied. 

\*

Positive reinforcement is
lacking: 

Learning new skills is useful, but only if those skills are
being utilized. With no on-going coaching and no drive to consistently apply
sales training through a solid sales system, there is no engine to keep
prospects moving forward.

\*

No accountability to
influence behavior: 

Encouragement to use sales training
techniques is inspired by the ability for sales executives and sales managers
alike to be able to track newly acquired sales tools. Without this practical
monitoring capability the impetus for reps to keep up 'good' techniques is lost.

\*

CRM software fails: 

From
lack of use to not delivering, Customer Relationship Manager systems also don't
work because they fail to drive sales executives' behavior.

\*

No sales pipeline
management: 

Sales executives need a system which shows them how to apply
sales techniques and sales training skills at each stage of the sales process. 

Not
only are there major disadvantages to sales leaders relying on sales training alone,
but this approach can actually take business success a few steps backward;
progression potential swinging towards profitability regression and failure.

__

_Sales training can be a deal breaker...literally!
_

\*

Sales managers under
pressure: 

If a sales team isn't value for money then bosses will
question whether their leader is too...

\*

Goals not reached: 

Sticking
to ineffective sales habits means opportunities are lost and sales results
suffer.

\*

Lost revenue: 

A
sales team operating without a clear, workable sales system will inevitably
experience sales drops and a dip in turnover and profits.

\*

Motivational slumps: 

Sales
jobs should be a welcome challenge, not an uphill struggle, otherwise
executives soon lose their zest to perform and succeed. 

\*

Wasted time and money: 

Less
deals and more valuable resources being spent on training that simply does not
deliver a sustainable ROI doesn't add up. Throwing more expense and energy at a
problem through sales training is not the answer. 

\*

HR instability: 

The
domino effect of a sales decline is faster turnover of sales executives which costs
and also creates a culture of insecurity and inconsistency. It can be difficult
for businesses to grow and develop with such a core weakness.

What
is needed to direct sales executives towards success is a sales system that
drives behavior through a proven sales pipeline management system; a system
that is transparent, encourages accountability, and drives deals.
